As the number of Covid-19 cases continue to raise in India, with limited number of covid-19 beds available, we need to effectively use the available beds. Also the Asymptomatic patients and the patients with minimal symptoms are not required to be treated in hospitals. These patients can be in home isolation. The patients in home isolation needs to be monitored time to time. If the pulse rate, blood pressure, temperature, Oxygen levels not in line with the recommendable range, the application should send notifications to the doctor portal immediately. On receiving the patient data, doctor may either prescribe medicine or refer the patient to admit to the hospital. If the doctor refers the patient to admit to the hospital, application should send notifications to ambulance service portal and to the patient.
